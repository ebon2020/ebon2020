## Hello, my name is Ethan Bondick.

  I am currently attending Columbia University, majoring in Financial Engineering. I am currently working on projects in Go and Python, and have done
extensive work in R for my summer employer. Most of my coding comes from personal passion projects at this point, for example, my Discord bot Friday.py.
This was my first true attempt at web scraping and API interactions. I am currently invested in an internal project (Odyn) which will eventually be 
an algorithmic trading bot. 

The best way to reach me is at ethan.bondick@gmail.com. Thank you for checking out my page.
